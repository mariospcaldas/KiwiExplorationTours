                  In the Māori language, "whānau" refers to extended family,
                  family group, or a familiar term of address for a group of
                  people. It encompasses a wider concept of family than just the
                  immediate nuclear family, often including close friends and
                  community members.

                  A marae is a fenced-in complex of carved buildings and grounds
                  that belongs to a particular iwi (tribe), hapū (sub-tribe) or
                  whānau (family). Māori see their marae as their tūrangawaewae
                  - their place to stand and belong.

                <p>
                  Pounamu (also known as greenstone or jade) is a valuable and
                  culturally significant material in Māori traditions, revered
                  for its beauty, strength, and spiritual connection. Pounamu is
                  considered a sacred stone with its own spirit, linked to
                  mountains and the land itself.

                <p>
                  Haka is a traditional Māori dance form, often performed in a
                  group and using loud chanting, facial expressions, and body
                  movements like foot stamping and hand slapping. It is a way to
                  express pride, strength, and unity.
